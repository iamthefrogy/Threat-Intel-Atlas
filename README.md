## 🛠️ How it works

- Scheduled GitHub Actions workflow pulls ~400 intelligence feeds daily.
- Python pipeline (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`) harmonises entries, deduplicates them, and stores structured JSON in `data/`.
- README and `site/index.html` are auto-rendered from templates with the newest signals.
- Cyberpunk UI lives in `site/` and is GitHub Pages-ready.

## 🚦 Local run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

## ➕ Add / update feeds

1. Edit `feeds.yaml` and append new sources under the `feeds:` list.
2. Keep the format:
   ```yaml
   - name: Your Feed Name
     url: https://example.com/feed
     category: vendor  # optional
   ```
3. Commit, push, or let the automated workflow pick it up on the next run.

## 🧪 Testing ideas

- Add pytest coverage for parsing if you extend the pipeline.
- Drop in custom tagging heuristics in `scripts/run_pipeline.py` to enrich metadata.
